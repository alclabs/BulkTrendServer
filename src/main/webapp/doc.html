<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    The trendserver Add-On to WebCTRL provides a
    <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a> style
    web service to retrieve trend samples more efficiently than the built in SOAP access.
</p>
<p>
    Data should be retrieved using an HTTP POST request to a URL of
    <span class="code"><span class="replacable">webctrl-server</span>/trendserver/read</span>.
</p>
<p>
    This Add-On uses <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">Basic Authentication</a>.
    The specified user must have the functional privilege in WebCTRL of &quot;Remote Data Access - SOAP&quot;.
</p>
<h1>Parameters</h1>
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>id</td>
            <td>
                ID of trend sources to retrieve.  Note that typically there will be multiple id parameters with the same
                parameter name.  These should be in the format returned by the Add-On API's
                <span class="code">Location.getPersistentLookupString</span>.  This is the format shown in the
                <span class="code">Lookup ID</span> column of the
                <a href="search.jsp">trend search page</a>.  An example of this format is
                &quot;<span class="code">ABSPATH:1:#electric_meter1/demand_tn</span>&quot;.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>format&nbsp;(optional)</td>
            <td>
                Valid values are: <span class="code">csv</span> (default) or <span class="code">json</span>.
                This parameter determines the format of the response (see <a href="#response">below</a>).
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>start</td>
            <td>
                Starting date to retrieve trends.  The date should be formatted as
                <span class="code">yyyy-mm-dd</span>, for example:
                &quot;<span class="code">2010-07-04</span>&quot; for the 4th of July, 2010.  The starting date is inclusive.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>end</td>
            <td>
                Ending date to retrieve trends.  The date should be in the same format as the start parameter.
                Trends will be retrieved through the end of the specified end date
                (exclusive of the midnight transitioning to the next day).  Midnight is considered to be part of
                the following day.  So to retrieve only one day's trends, specify the same date for start and end.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>defaultdigits&nbsp;(optional)</td>
            <td>
                The default number of digits past the decimal place to use for the string representation of analog data.  For the version of the
                Add-On API prior to WebCTRL 5, this value is always used.  For WebCTRL 5 and later, most trend sources
                know their own precision and will use their native precision instead.  The default value for defaultdigits
                is 2.
            </td>

<h1><a id="response">Response Format</a></h1>
<div class="indent">
    <h2>CSV Format</h2>
    <p>
        In the CSV format, the samples from each data source is on a single line terminated with a carriage return.
        The first entry on each line is the id of the trend source escaped
        <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">according to the rules of CSV</a>
        if necessary.  The remaining entries are pairs of timestamps and values.  All entries on a line are separated by a comma.
    </p>
    <p>
        Timestamps are encoded as an integer string representing the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 in
        the local timezone for the site of the trend source.  For example, <span class="code">1278261000000</span>,
        is July 4th, 2010 at 12:30pm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Analog values are encoded as floating point number string with up to <span class="replacable">defaultdigits</span>
        digits past the decimal place.  Trailing 0's are removed and integers will have no decimal point.
    </p>
    <p>
        Digital values will either be the string &quot;true&quot; or the string &quot;false&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example encoding for two sources with two samples each.
<pre>
ABSPATH:1:#board_room/ht_stpt_tn,1282017600000,55.1,1282017900000,55
ABSPATH:1:#board_room/locked_tn,1282017600000,false,1282017900000,true
</pre>
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>JSON Format</h2>
    <p>
        In the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> format, the overall result is an array of trend source source objects.  Each trend source
        object has an id with key of &quot;id&quot; and an array of samples with a key of &quot;s&quot;.
        Each sample in the array has a timestamp with a key of &quot;t&quot; and a value.  The key for the
        value depends on the type of data.  Analog values have a key of &quot;a&quot; and digital values have a
        a key of &quot;d&quot;.  The string encoding for both dates and values is identical to what is used
        in the CSV format.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the order keys are written into an object is not guaranteed.</p>
    <p>
        Example encoding for two sources with two samples each.
        Note that this has been broken into multiple lines and white space has been added for clarity.
        The real result has no whitespace and is all on one line:
    
<pre>
[
  {
    "id":"ABSPATH:1:#board_room/ht_stpt_tn",
    "s":[{"t":"1282017600000","a":"55.1"},{"t":"1282017900000","a":"55"}]
  },
  {
    "id":"ABSPATH:1:#board_room/locked_tn",
    "s":[{"t":"1282017600000","d":"false"},{"t":"1282017900000","d":"true"}]
  }
]
</pre>
    </p>
</div>
<br>

<h1>Special Samples</h1>
<p>
    WebCTRL captures a number of types of &quot;special&quot; samples such as time synch messages, or indications that trending
    was enabled or disabled.  None of these types of samples are returned throught this add-on.  Only actual data samples
    will be retrieved.
</p>
<br>

<h1>Optimizing Reads</h1>
<p>
    This add-on intentionally does not force the server to read data from the field.  It only reads data from the WebCTRL
    trend database.  Any trend sources you will use should be configured to push their data to the server before you will
    attempt to retrieve it.  Typically, this is handled by making sure that trends are reported from the field every 6
    hours or so.  In this case, you might wait to retrieve trends another day.  For example, an automated retrieval program
    running at 1am Wednesday morning might retrieve the data from all day on Monday.  The <a href="search.jsp">trend search page</a>
    can display the upload period for a trend source (how often all the trends are sent from the field modules to the server).
</p>
<p>
    This add-on will support gzip encoding of the http stream if the request indicates it is supported.  Add &quot;gzip&quot;
    to the list of encodings in the Accept-Encoding header.  This can improve performance over slower connections.
